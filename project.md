### OOPS concept use
* used for authorization, whose object can be created to use the methods
* discriminator used in models, to show inheritance
##### WORKING
Discriminators are particularly useful when you have a base schema (for shared fields) and additional fields that differ between types. For example, if you have    a User model that is shared between different user roles like Customer, Manager, and Delivery Partner, you can use discriminators to extend the User model and      add role-specific fields.
* get, update methods are created in a single class, whose object can be instantiated to access the methods, for ex for admin routes
