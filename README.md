# Welcome to Food Delivery Website: Meal Monkey
MealMonkey is a food ordering and delivery website,
We have 4 kinds of users,

- Customer: Customer can filter restaruants by items, view restaurant details, menu and review, A customer can also write a review for a restaurant.He can manage the cart, place an order and view it.

-Restaurant: A restaurant can view it's statistics in the dashboard, manage the menu (add items, edit them). It can also view and edit it's profile. It can additionally view it's orders and reivews.

-DeliveryPartner: He can view his details and statistics in the dashboard,Can accept pending orders,view active order details and location on the map. Edit profile,

-Admin: Can view website statistics, like customers joined, restaruants joined, daily profit etc. He can view restaurants, its' statistics, users,deliveryPartners. Can create and fetch users with mailid and delete them.

-Guest user is an additional user who can view restaurants and their menus but can't add items to the cart or place an order.

Business Logic- Out of the total price of the order deducted from the customer's wallet, 80% goes to the restaurant, 10% to the admin and delivery partner each.
